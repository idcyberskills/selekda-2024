# ISO Audit Bypass

PT BADUT was getting audited last week and Dicky, one of the new employee is absent due to his sickness. Although there are some rumors that Dicky has a bad history since he was ever jailed due to selling inappropiate images and videos in the dark web. 

In order to prove Dicky's innocence, the company had a prerogative rights fully to the employee's device and told the IT administrator, Karamboye to carefully examine his laptop when Dicky's away from keyboard. Now since he's going out for a few minutes, Karamboye's acquiring his laptop's live memory dump and it's up to you now!

Notes: The following objectives MAY be true or false based from your investigation. These questions are not yet to be proven and only come up from a hypotheses.

Use your best forensic skills to dive into it.

* The company policy is quite restricted when it comes to the employee's device. They **SHOULD NOT** be able to access any application besides a basic ones, even downloading an application require a permission from administrator (**EXCEPT** known browser apps for the following ones IE/Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Brave, and Opera respectively, and also XAMPP as a development application). Is/Are there any application(s) downloaded in his device? How many times that they're/it is executed?

* If the answer above is YES, how many applications are there? Is/Are there any malicious/suspected application(s) related to his past? What is/are it/they? If the answer above is NO, is he trying to open/execute any suspicious files which is/are stored in the OS? The files/apps might not be downloaded but transferred.

* Notice that Dicky is part of the IT Developer but he's still a newbie. The company's still using old framework and classic backend program. Is/Are there any suspicious URLs/links that Dicky opened in his browser(s)? What are they? 

Notes: The current website which are built is in http(s)://testing.selekda.com , if you found something other than that which he visited and it's/they're not like a normal ones, please report it/them! If you also discover a hidden credential which also belong to Dicky THAT IS NOT related to `testing.selekda.com` or other official application services, please report it as well!

If there isn't, please note all of his browser history URLs and both answers should state how many times it's/they're being opened.

* Our current dev team needs to pay attention from leaking the internal documents or other confidential information especially when devs are debugging code in the browser. Debugging involved XAMPP. Is there any activity related to that from Dicky's device? Did he somehow save certain secret information?

Additional Notes: If you found `notelpbos.zip` , it's normal since it has been there when the laptop is not given yet and don't try to crack it because it's useless. The license should also not be tampered just like from the message file, the original ones is `123456789!!@@%!^*!(()!()!)`. If you found out that the value is already tampered, please report it!

* [BONUS] If you figured out the malicious activity chain, please report it by chronological order (hypothese). Else, if you figured out something more than that , please report it as well for the validity.

There's no SELEKDA{} flag in here üòÅ.
