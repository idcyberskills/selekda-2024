Cache poisoning via route misintrepretation in Cloudflare

# POC
- Flag is admin's bio.
- Bio of a user can be obtained from /bio/<user_id>, but the user_id is in fact useless because the bio data is obtained via session (no IDOR here)
- But, since the route definition of bio route is /bio/*, we can specify /bio/something.css and still get the same reponse (contains the user's bio)
- Every request that ends in .css will be cached by Cloudflare
- To get the flag, user has to make admin visit /bio/something.css until Cloudflare cache the response
- Then user open /bio/something.css from his/her side, if the page has been cached previously, the flag will be there.
