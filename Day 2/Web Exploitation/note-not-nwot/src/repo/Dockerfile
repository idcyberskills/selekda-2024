# Step 1: Use the official Golang image as the build environment
FROM golang:1.23-alpine AS build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Go modules file and download dependencies
COPY go.mod .
RUN go mod download

# Copy the rest of the application source code
COPY . .

# Build the Go app
RUN go build -o myapp .

# Step 2: Use a smaller image (like Alpine) to run the built binary
FROM alpine:latest

ARG FLAG

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN sed -i "s/FLAG/$FLAG/g" notes/flag.json

# Copy the binary from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/myapp .

# Expose any ports (optional, depends on your app)
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the binary
CMD ["./myapp"]
